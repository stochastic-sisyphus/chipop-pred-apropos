   - No scenario-based projections

## Model Implementation Issues

1. **Multifamily Growth Model Deficiencies**
   - Fails to identify top 5 ZIPs with new multifamily growth
   - Missing analysis of areas with 10+ years of little activity
   - Limited historical data analysis
   - Poor identification of emerging areas

2. **Retail Gap Model Limitations**
   - Incomplete identification of retail development gaps
   - Missing analysis of housing/population growth â‰¥20%
   - Poor prioritization of South/West sides
   - No flagging of high housing growth + low retail areas

3. **Retail Void Model Issues**
   - Incomplete spending leakage analysis
   - Missing retail category analysis
   - No integration with economic context
   - Poor identification of retail voids

4. **Missing Population Forecast Model**
   - No implementation of population forecasting
   - Missing migration pattern analysis
   - Absent demographic trend modeling
   - No scenario-based population projections

## Pipeline Integration Issues

1. **Error Handling Deficiencies**
   - Limited error logging and reporting
