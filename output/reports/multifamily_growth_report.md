# Top 5 Emerging Multifamily Areas Report

**Generated on:** 2025-05-26

## Executive Summary

This report identifies the top 5 ZIP codes in Chicago showing significant multifamily development growth in areas that previously had low permit activity. These emerging areas represent prime opportunities for retail development and community services to support growing residential populations.

## Key Findings

- **** ZIP codes were identified as emerging multifamily development areas
- These areas showed historically low activity (10+ years ago) but significant recent growth
- The average growth score across all emerging areas is **4.30**

## Top 5 Emerging ZIP Codes

| Rank | ZIP Code | Growth Score | Recent Unit Count | Growth Ratio |
|------|----------|--------------|-------------------|--------------|

| 1 | 60697 | 233.00 | 325 | 326.00x |

| 2 | 60669 | 165.10 | 228 | 229.00x |

| 3 | 60678 | 163.80 | 227 | 228.00x |

| 4 | 60639 | 162.50 | 226 | 227.00x |

| 5 | 60691 | 130.40 | 181 | 182.00x |


## Growth Pattern Analysis

The following visualization shows the relationship between historical multifamily development (10-15 years ago) and recent development (last 5 years). Emerging areas are those that had minimal historical development but have seen significant recent activity.

## Growth Distribution

The distribution of growth ratios across all ZIP codes shows where the top emerging areas fall relative to the overall market. ZIP codes with the highest growth ratios represent areas undergoing the most dramatic transformation.

## Implications for Development

These emerging multifamily areas present significant opportunities for:

1. **Retail Development**: New residents will need convenient shopping options
2. **Community Services**: Schools, healthcare, and public spaces will need to expand
3. **Transportation**: Infrastructure may need upgrades to support population growth
4. **Mixed-Use Development**: Opportunities for ground-floor retail with residential above

## Methodology

This analysis identified emerging multifamily areas using the following approach:

1. Analyzed historical permit data (10-15 years ago) to identify areas with low multifamily activity
2. Analyzed recent permit data (last 5 years) to identify areas with high multifamily activity
3. Calculated growth metrics including unit growth ratio and permit growth ratio
4. Created a composite growth score to rank emerging areas
5. Filtered to areas that were historically low in activity but recently high

## Data Sources

- Building permits data from Chicago Department of Buildings
- Housing unit counts from Census and American Community Survey
- Project status and completion data from Chicago Department of Planning and Development
