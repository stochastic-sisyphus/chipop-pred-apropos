## Implications for Development

The retail void and spending leakage analysis provides specific guidance for targeted retail development:

1. **Category-Specific Opportunities**: Rather than general retail, focus on specific missing categories in each ZIP code
2. **Spending Recapture Potential**: Quantified potential for recapturing spending currently leaving the area
3. **Complementary Development**: Identify retail categories that complement existing businesses
4. **Right-Sized Development**: Scale retail development to match local spending potential

## Methodology

This analysis identified retail voids and spending leakage using the following approach:

1. Calculated spending potential by ZIP code and retail category based on population and income
2. Estimated local vs. outbound spending based on existing retail businesses
3. Calculated leakage ratio (outbound spending / total spending potential)
4. Identified retail voids where leakage ratio > 0.7 and business count < 3
5. Calculated void score based on leakage ratio and spending potential
6. Prioritized opportunities by void score

## Data Sources

- Consumer spending data from Bureau of Economic Analysis
- Retail business data from City of Chicago Business Licenses
- Income and demographic data from American Community Survey
- Retail category classifications from North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)
