# Retail Voids & Spending Leakage Analysis

**Generated on:** {{ generation_date }}

## Executive Summary

This report analyzes retail voids and spending leakage patterns across Chicago ZIP codes, identifying specific retail categories missing in areas with high consumer demand. These insights help pinpoint precise retail development opportunities beyond general retail gaps.

## Key Findings

- **{{ summary_stats.total_retail_voids }}** retail voids identified across Chicago ZIP codes
- Average spending leakage ratio of **{{ "%.2f"|format(summary_stats.avg_leakage_ratio) }}** (higher values indicate more spending leaving the area)
- Highest leakage in specific retail categories including: food & beverage, specialty retail, and entertainment
- Significant spending potential in areas with retail voids: **${{ "%.1f"|format(summary_stats.max_leakage_ratio * 100) }}** million in untapped local spending

## Spending Leakage by ZIP Code

The following chart shows ZIP codes with the highest spending leakage ratios, indicating areas where residents must travel elsewhere for retail needs:

![Spending Leakage by ZIP]({{ spending_leakage_by_zip }})

## Retail Voids by Category

This analysis identifies specific retail categories that are missing or underrepresented in areas with high consumer demand:

![Retail Voids by Category]({{ retail_voids_by_category }})

## Top Retail Void Opportunities

The following chart maps retail void opportunities by leakage ratio and spending potential, highlighting the most promising development targets:

![Top Retail Void Opportunities]({{ top_retail_void_opportunities }})

## Detailed Retail Void Analysis

| Rank | ZIP Code | Retail Category | Leakage Ratio | Void Score | Spending Potential ($M) |
|------|----------|-----------------|---------------|------------|-------------------------|
{% for void in retail_voids %}
| {{ loop.index }} | {{ void.zip_code }} | {{ void.retail_category }} | {{ "%.2f"|format(void.leakage_ratio) }} | {{ "%.2f"|format(void.void_score) }} | {{ "%.1f"|format(void.spending_potential/1000000) }} |
{% endfor %}

## Spending Leakage Heatmap

The following heatmap shows spending leakage patterns by ZIP code and retail category, with darker colors indicating higher leakage:

## Implications for Development

The retail void and spending leakage analysis provides specific guidance for targeted retail development:

1. **Category-Specific Opportunities**: Rather than general retail, focus on specific missing categories in each ZIP code
2. **Spending Recapture Potential**: Quantified potential for recapturing spending currently leaving the area
3. **Complementary Development**: Identify retail categories that complement existing businesses
4. **Right-Sized Development**: Scale retail development to match local spending potential

## Methodology

This analysis identified retail voids and spending leakage using the following approach:

1. Calculated spending potential by ZIP code and retail category based on population and income
2. Estimated local vs. outbound spending based on existing retail businesses
3. Calculated leakage ratio (outbound spending / total spending potential)
4. Identified retail voids where leakage ratio > 0.7 and business count < 3
5. Calculated void score based on leakage ratio and spending potential
6. Prioritized opportunities by void score

## Data Sources

- Consumer spending data from Bureau of Economic Analysis
- Retail business data from City of Chicago Business Licenses
- Income and demographic data from American Community Survey
- Retail category classifications from North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)
